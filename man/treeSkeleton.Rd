\title{This class implements iterators for a tree-based structure
without an actual underlying tree.}
\description{
In other dynamic languages, this kind of behavior would be called
duck typing. Imagine we have an object \code{x} that is of some
reference class. This object has a tree structure, and each node
in the tree has a parent and children. However, the methods to
fetch a node's parent or its children may have arbitrary names.
These names are stored in \code{treeSkeleton}'s \code{parent_caller}
and \code{children_caller} fields. Thus, if \code{x$methods()}
refers to \code{x}'s children and \code{x$parent_method()} refers
to \code{x}'s parent, we could define a \code{treeSkeleton} for
\code{x} by writing \code{treeSkeleton$new(x, 'parent_method', 'methods')}.
}
\details{
The iterators on a \code{treeSkeleton} use the standard definition of
successor, predecessor, ancestor, etc.
